# PyTorch Tutorial

Welcome to the PyTorch Tutorial repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that introduces the major functionalities of PyTorch with explanations and demos.

## Introduction

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and efficient framework for building and training deep learning models. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computation graph, easy-to-use API, and strong support for GPU acceleration.

## Contents

The tutorial covers the following major functionalities of PyTorch:

1. **Tensors**: Core data structures similar to NumPy arrays, but with additional capabilities for GPU computing.
2. **Autograd**: Automatic differentiation library that supports dynamic computation graphs, allowing gradients to be computed for tensor operations.
3. **NN Module**: High-level neural network API for building and training neural networks, including layers, loss functions, and optimizers.
4. **Optim**: Package containing optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and RMSProp for training models.
5. **Data Utilities**: Tools for loading and processing data, including datasets, data loaders, and transformations.
6. **CUDA Integration**: Support for GPU acceleration using CUDA, allowing for efficient computation on NVIDIA GPUs.
7. **TorchScript**: A way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code, enabling deployment in production environments.
8. **Distributed Training**: Functionality for training large models on multiple GPUs and across multiple nodes.
9. **JIT Compilation**: Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance and enable efficient model deployment.
10. **Interoperability**: Compatibility with other frameworks and tools, such as ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) for exporting models to other frameworks or deployment environments.
11. **Pre-trained Models**: Access to a variety of pre-trained models and model architectures through the `torchvision`, `torchtext`, `torchaudio`, and other libraries.
12. **Visualization**: Integration with TensorBoard and other visualization tools for monitoring and debugging training processes.
13. **Dataloader Utilities**: Efficient loading and preprocessing of data, supporting multi-threaded data loading and data augmentation techniques.
14. **Dynamic Computation Graphs**: Ability to change the graph on-the-fly with each iteration, offering more flexibility than static computation graphs.
15. **Hub**: Access to a wide range of pre-trained models and scripts, making it easier to use state-of-the-art models for various tasks.
16. **Mobile Support**: Tools and libraries for deploying PyTorch models on mobile devices.
17. **ONNX Runtime**: Integration with ONNX Runtime for faster inference.
18. **Custom C++/CUDA Extensions**: Ability to write custom C++ and CUDA extensions for more optimized performance.
